# SEBART-PRO
Summer Project (B-Tech 1st year)

A self-balancing robot designed to track and follow objects. It can recognize traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network and perform prefined actions like following a ball. The bot uses a PID control algorithm and feedback from an IMU to stay balanced on two wheels. It houses a  Raspberry Pi to implement Computer Vision.
